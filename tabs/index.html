                <h3>Pop</h3>
                <p>
                  Pop is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern
                  form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United
                  Kingdom. The terms popular music and pop music are often used
                  interchangeably, although the former describes all music that
                  is popular and includes many disparate styles. During the
                  1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the
                  youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop remained
                  roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop
                  became associated with music that was more commercial,
                  ephemeral, and accessible.

                <p>
                  Electronic dance music (EDM), also known as dance music, club
                  music, or simply dance, is a broad range of percussive
                  electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves,
                  and festivals. It is generally produced for playback by DJs
                  who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by
                  segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also
                  perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in
                  what is sometimes called a live PA.

                <h3>Rhythm and blues (R&B)</h3>
                <p>
                  Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B, is a genre of
                  popular music that originated in African-American communities
                  in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies
                  to describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African
                  Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music
                  with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular. In
                  the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s
                  through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one
                  or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and
                  sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often
                  encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the
                  quest for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in
                  terms of relationships, economics, and aspirations.
